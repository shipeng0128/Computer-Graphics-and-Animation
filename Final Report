-Images with problems: The following images shows the one of the bugs that I spent most time debuging.
    For this image, there are too much noise in it. And there are some parts of the image that did not get correctly generated.
  
  

Description of my implementation:
    For this project, I implemented a ray tracer, which is a computer rendering teahnique that can realistically simulate the lighting of a scene and an object.
To achieve such object, according to the order of my implemenation, at first, the program traverse through the surface of the object to see what a ray will hit 
on the object. To do this, I implemented the intersect() function, which helps the program to check if the ray hits the triangles and spheres that form the 
object together. After accomplishing this step, the output will be an outline of the image. Then, the next step will be the shaing part. For this part, the 
program will check for the shadows first. Then, the program will do the shading. For the code of shading, most of the logic and code are copied from the first 
assignment of this course.(The shading assignment). Finally, the last part I implemented is the reflection and the refraction.

The problems that I encountered:
    To me, the biggest problem I faced is debugging. Most of the time, it takes me a lot of time to debug. When implementing the intersect() function,
I am having a bug which can not generate any output. In this case, I have no idea what the problem with my code is. In addition, the running time of the 
program troubles me a lot as well. After implementing most parts of the program, I start to debug the program as a whole. At this time, it takes several minutes
for my laptop to generate a output. As a result, it makes my debugging process very inefficient. 
    When writin the code with some complex formula, it is very confusing to me that I have to implement a calculation seperately. For example, when writing the
