-Example Images: The following images are the outputs of the ray-tracing program using the images from the input files as inputs.



-Images with problems: The following images shows the one of the bugs that I spent most time debuging.
  For this image, there are too much noise in it. And there are some parts of the image that did not get correctly generated.
  
  

Description of the project:
  For this project, I implemented a ray tracer, which is a computer rendering teahnique that can realistically simulate the
lighting of a scene and an object. To achieve such object, at first, the program traverse through the surface of the object 
to see what a ray will hit on the object. To do this, I implemented the intersect() function, which helps the program to check
if the ray hits the triangles and spheres that form the object together. After accomplishing this step, the output will be an outline of 
the image. Then, the next step will be
